# CSS |列属性

> 原文:[https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/css-columns-property/](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/css-columns-property/)

在 CSS 中*列*属性用于设置列的数量和列的宽度。这是一个简写属性，一次可以取多个值。

**语法:**

```
columns: column-width columns-count | auto | initial | inherit;

```

**属性值:**

*   **auto:** This sets the column-width and column-count values to their browser default values.

    **语法:**

    ```
    columns: auto auto;

    ```

    **示例 1:** 使用*自动*作为值。
