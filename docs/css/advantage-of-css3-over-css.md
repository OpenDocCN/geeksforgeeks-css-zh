CSS3 是 CSS 的最新版本。它比它的前身有许多优点。CSS3 在 2010 年初开始流行。当时，一些浏览器甚至不支持 CSS3，因此网络开发人员社区需要一段时间才能开始在他们的项目中实现这一点。在这里，我们将看到 CSS3 相对于 CSS 的优势，也将讨论为什么 CSS3 在短时间内获得如此巨大的人气。

*   **Responsiveness:** CSS3 naturally supports responsive design and has the ability to handle media queries. Media query helps to make the website respond, because we can apply personalized CSS attributes for different screen widths. Therefore, the website looks good on every device visited.
*   **Color:** New color formats such as RGBA (red, green, blue, Alpha), HSL (hue, saturation, lightness) and HSLA (hue, saturation, lightness, Alpha) have been added. It helps web designers because it helps them apply styles and different color effects to their web pages. Gradient and opacity properties have also been added.
*   **Reduce alignment problems:** Box resizing has fixed some annoying alignment problems, because now developers can use padding, margins and other attributes to give partitions an appropriate size. It helps to create complex web page structures. CSS grids help to create responsive web pages without using table rows and columns. Therefore, the alignment problem has been solved, making the website mobile friendly easier.
*   **Animation:** CSS requires developers to use scripting language to create animation. On the other hand, CSS3 introduces animation features such as text shadow. It reduces the workload of developers, because it is difficult to apply such animation in the early stage, but with the introduction of these new CSS attributes, it becomes much easier.
*   **Compatibility:** As mentioned earlier, CSS3 was not supported by many browsers at the time of publishing, so it will take some time for developers to master this point. Now, however, every modern browser supports CSS3, which is why every website established now uses CSS3 instead of ordinary CSS.
*   **JavaScript independence loads faster:** As discussed above, early developers had to mix JavaScript and CSS to provide even simple decorations like text shadows. With the introduction of CSS3, the dependence of CSS on JS has decreased, thus reducing the loading time of web pages.
*   **Testing:** The earlier version of CSS was a bit complicated in the testing part. However, CSS3 is divided into smaller modules, which makes it easier for users to run compatibility tests and test components separately. Therefore, bug detection becomes easier and saves a lot of time and energy for trouble.
*   **Platform-friendly:** CSS3 is compatible with all platforms or devices such as mobile phones and tablets.
*   **Border radius:** Border radius CSS attribute helps to make the shapes of the border and div elements of the image round, which used to require a lot of formatting and photoshop work. Another big problem is its support for fillet images. Other attributes such as shadows have also been added.

因此，这就是 CSS3 的突然流行背后的原因，以及 CSS3 相对于 CSS 的优势。
